This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Creates a new Gutenberg Block Type, "SBGD Wrapper Block", that is simply a container for other blocks. It is completely unstyled on the front end, so it is meant for developers building custom themes. I couldn't find something so simple already out there so I just created it for myself. :-)
