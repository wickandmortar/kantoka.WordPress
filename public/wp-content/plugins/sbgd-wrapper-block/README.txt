Creates a new Gutenberg Block Type, "SBGD Wrapper Block", that is simply a container for other blocks.

== Description ==

This project was bootstrapped with [Create Guten Block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block).

Creates a new Gutenberg Block Type, "SBGD Wrapper Block", that is simply a container for other blocks. It is completely unstyled on the front end, so it is meant for developers building custom themes. I wanted a container block that did not add dozens of css and js files to my sites and couldn't find anything out there so I just created it for myself. :-)

This plugin does not load **any** CSS or JS on the front end, and the only options in the editor are the basic ones for adding ID and class names, and align properties (if your theme supports), so this block will not be useful unless you're writing your own CSS.

== Installation ==

How to install the plugin and get it working:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
